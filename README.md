# Welcome to Aigneis, David, and Owen's final project

## TODO
- Get 3D reconstruction working in a vacuum
- Get trajectory optimization working on simple maps that are known apriori
- Make some semi-smart goal-selection logic to explore the unknown map
- Interface them
- Fake some realtime behavior by taking a couple snapshots of a map as its being generated and then giving these to the trajectory optimizer to simulate exploring the map as its being generated
